Change your external link to an internal link by changing the href attribute to "#footer" and the text from cat photos to Jump to Bottom.

Remove the target="_blank" attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in a new window tab.

Then add an id attribute with a value of footer to the <footer> element at the bottom of the page.

     radio buttons 
     Radio buttons are a type of input.

Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.

All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.

    Here, you have two radio inputs. When the user submits the form with the indoor option selected, the form data will include the line: indoor-outdoor=indoor. This is from the name and value attributes of the "indoor" input.

If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on. In this scenario, if the user clicked the "indoor" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful. So the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option.

You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.

    <input id = "indoor" value = "indoor" type = "radio" name = "indoor-outdoor"> Indoor </label>
